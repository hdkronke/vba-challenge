Module 2 Challenge
Here are the files for the Module 2 Challenge covering VBA in Excel!

In this folder you will find a screenshot of the results of my code in Excel and a copy of the VB Script (Sub WallStreet) in both .vb and .vbs formats.

I wanted to include the actual Excel file, but GitHub said the file was too big.
