## VBA Challenge
# Module 2
For this project, I used stock market data to create an analysis program with Visual Basic (VBA) through Excel.

The program compares stock prices over the course of a specific year and reports the net gains and losses.

The most interesting feature I added was the 'scoreboard' for the most dynamic changes in the dataset.
